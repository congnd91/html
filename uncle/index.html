                        <ul>
                            <li>Give users fantastic advice that aligns with users’ goals and interests at all times.</li>
                            <li>Disposition users correctly in the CRM. We use this data to attract new users who are most likely to become your clients (using machine learning, AI, and other buzzwords.. We practically 3D print the best clients for you). </li>
                            <li>Receive and use their own custom link to build plans with their existing ecosystem. These plans will appear in the CRM, with a unique identifier, alongside the new Planswell leads.</li>
                            <li>Not disparage Planswell, it’s employees, or affiliates, on the internet or anywhere else. </li>
                            <li>Represent the Planswell brand in accordance with the initial and ongoing training.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Planswell Corp. will... </h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Distribute your leads exclusively. No other advisor, or even Planswell, will solicit them without your approval.</li>
                            <li>Call some of your leads for feedback on their process to ensure enthusiastic satisfaction and to improve Planswell’s user experience. </li>
                            <li>Keep your information top secret. Your name, company name, planswell activity or anything else we learn about you will never be disclosed to anyone else, in accordance with our super detailed Privacy Policy. </li>
                            <li>Provide online training, coaching, support, and love to you via frequent live webinars. </li>
                            <li>Share all our learnings from onboarding thousands of clients around the world. </li>
                            <li>At our sole discretion, distribute the pinnacle leads (formerly held demos, booked calls, organic, etc.) to the advisors who we feel are serving clients most effectively. </li>
                            <li>At our sole discretion, distribute additional free leads that may include low implementation likelihood, low income, legacy leads, etc. (for every plan we generate and distribute, there is at least one other plan that we did not deem high quality enough to include in your membership). These are great leads for email nurture campaigns. Distribution is based on our perception of advisor success on the platform. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Terms of Service - Plain Language</h3>
                        <p>We try to keep everything as simple as possible so we’ve explained much of our terms of service in plain language below. There is a second section that lawyers get all excited about. It’s there as well. Both sections are considered to be part of the entire terms of service and use of Planswell Corp. services.</p>
                        <h5>Cancel whenever you want</h5>
                        <p>We don’t require anyone to commit beyond month to month. We might change the pricing, but we’ll give you enough notice to cancel if you don’t agree. Locking in a longer term contract may be something we offer to keep your rate the same for a period of time. </p>
                        <h5>Don‘t take anything personally</h5>
                        <p>Everything you see on our site, such as an article or a video or even a link to another website, is meant to provide general information. It is not meant to be taken as legal, accounting, financial, insurance, borrowing or tax advice, and it is not meant as an offer to sell anything. Users must create their own financial plan and talk to licensed advisors in order to receive advice on their personal situation.</p>
                        <h5>Let us know if you see a mistake</h5>
                        <p>We love to help people understand money better. But we’re only human, so there will occasionally be a mistake on this site, or on a site that we link to. It could be a typo, an out-of-date number, or even something worded incorrectly. If something doesn’t look right to you, let us know and we’ll clear it up right away, but you can’t sue us over it.</p>
                        <h5>Please respect our stuff</h5>
                        <p>Everything on our site is protected by copyright and trademark laws. You are welcome to share our site with anyone you wish. You may be able to reproduce some of the content from our site if you talk to us about it first. But you are not allowed to take things from our site and publish them elsewhere without our permission. It’s not only illegal, it’s not nice.</p>
                        <p>Going to court over something on a website seems unlikely, but if a dispute ever happens, it will be settled in the city of Toronto under the laws of Ontario and/or Canada. Below are the longer, and more exhaustive terms of service provided by our lawyers. You also agree to these below by using our service.</p>
