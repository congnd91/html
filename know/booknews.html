                            </p>
                            <p>Uncle Sam has a lot of rules and regulations and he has a very long reach when it comes to taxation. Author Angela Preteau demonstrates that If you are associated in some financial way with the United States you need to know that the IRS is placing a higher focus on foreign taxpayers, including its own citizens living in Canada. As well, in Canada, international and cross-border taxation is big news as the taxman looks for cross-border tax cheats, and demands more information about offshore holdings. Canadians & the IRS can help you know your rights and obligations.</p>
