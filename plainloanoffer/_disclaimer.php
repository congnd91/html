    <p>Consumers submitting an application for a loan at <? echo ucfirst($domain); ?> incur no
        cost. <? echo ucfirst($domain); ?> does not provide lending services directly to consumers.
        Based on the application consumers submit, <? echo ucfirst($domain); ?> searches its database
        housing its vast network of reliable lenders to pair consumers with the lender and
        loan ideally suited to their needs.</p>
    <p>All fees and rate information will be disclosed to consumers by their lender at the
        time of approval. Upon conclusion of the search and application approval, you will
        be redirected to an e-signature page provided to you by the lender to which you
        were matched. This document will contain all fees and rate information pertaining
        to the loan being offered by a lender from the <? echo ucfirst($domain); ?> network. Consumers
        are required to review the fee and rate information provided by their lender at
        this time thoroughly and completely before agreeing to the terms of the loan. Consumers
        are under no obligation to accept these terms.</p>
    <p>If the consumer decides the loan terms detailed in the lender contract are acceptable
        and wishes to proceed with the loan process, consumer may append an e-signature
        to the page. Once the consumer enters into a legally binding contract with the lender,
        consumer assumes all costs and risks associated with the contract. At that point,
        the consumer is obligated solely to the lender and is never at any point obligated
        to <? echo ucfirst($domain); ?>. The loan fees and interest rates are determined solely
        by the lender to which the consumer is matched, with specific amounts determined
        based upon the application information submitted. <? echo ucfirst($domain); ?> has no
        bearing on the determination of these fee amounts and interest rates.</p>

        seek out debt and credit advisory help. Consumers are encouraged to consult our
        Rates and Fees page to learn more about the risks involved with cash advances, local

        does not guarantee that completing an application form will result in you being
        matched with a service provider or lender, being offered a loan product with satisfactory

        credit reporting bureaus: Experian, Equifax, or Trans Union. However, credit checks
        or consumer reports through alternative providers such as Teletrack or DP Bureau,
        which typically will not affect your credit score, may be obtained by some service
        providers or lenders, in certain circumstances. Learn more about Rates & Fees.</p>
