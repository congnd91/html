                            Not all lenders can provide you with a loan. If you are approved, you will receive funds according to the lender's funding practices which vary from lender to lender. Repayment terms also vary from lender to lender and may be affected by state law. If
                            you have questions about the loan terms offered to you, or about a loan that has funded, please contact the lender directly. We are not a lender and cannot give you loan-specific information.

                            You will not be charged a fee for using our service. Loan-related fees are controlled by the lender and will be disclosed to you before you accept the loan. If you do not want to incur loan-related fees or you are unable to repay your loan, do not accept
                            the loan.
