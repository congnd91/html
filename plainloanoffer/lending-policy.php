                        <h1>Policy on Responsible Lending</h1>
                        <p>This website wants consumers to be educated, make smart financial decisions, and to be protected from malicious personal consumer lenders and other unsavory businesses that engage in unlawful and unethical lending practices.</p>
                        <h3>Trust and Truth</h3>
                        <p>Our policies and practices conform to applicable provisions of fair lending laws like the Truth in Lending Act. Before a consumer enters into a loan agreement, the lender should provide you in writing (this can be electronically)
                            with the exact fees, rates, charges, roll over charges and other details. Visit the Rates and Fees section of this website to learn about current regulations and laws in your state.</p>
                        <h3>Fair Lending</h3>
                        <p>The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act states that all lenders must engage in "fair lending" practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau enforces fair lending rules and regulations.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Practices for Fair Debt Collection</h3>
                        <p>This website is committed to working with lenders that obey the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. We are not the lender or debt collector. Lenders in our network are required to avoid the following practices:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Calling consumers on their telephone prior to 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m. (or as otherwise regulated by specific state laws).
                            </li>
                            <li>Calling consumers with the malicious intent of harassing, or annoying or even using abusive language.
                            </li>
                            <li>Using misrepresentation and deception for debt collection purposes.</li>
                            <li>Threatening with legal recourse or criminal charges even though no such action is allowed.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We will not do business with lenders that intentionally and repeatedly violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.</p>
                        <h3>Current State Regulations</h3>
                        <p>We encourage lenders to follow applicable federal and state regulations. This includes conformity with local laws regarding interest rates, maximum loan terms, rollover limits, fees, cooling-off periods in between loans, and other
                            loan terms. Lenders that are an extension of a federally recognized Indian Tribe act as independent sovereign nations and may not be required to follow local laws regarding rates, fees and other loan terms, although such lenders
                            conform to federal lending laws including the Truth in Lending Act.</p>

                            Not all lenders can provide you with a loan. If you are approved, you will receive funds according to the lender's funding practices which vary from lender to lender. Repayment terms also vary from lender to lender and may be affected by state law. If
                            you have questions about the loan terms offered to you, or about a loan that has funded, please contact the lender directly. We are not a lender and cannot give you loan-specific information.

                            You will not be charged a fee for using our service. Loan-related fees are controlled by the lender and will be disclosed to you before you accept the loan. If you do not want to incur loan-related fees or you are unable to repay your loan, do not accept
                            the loan.
