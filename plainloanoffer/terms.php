                        <p>Our Company doing business as Website, owns and operates this website. We provide and maintains this Site for your information, conditioned on your acceptance, without modification, of the terms, conditions and notices contained
                            in these Terms of Use and in our Privacy Policy. By accessing and using the Site, you accept and agree without limitation to the following:</p>
                        <h3>PRODUCTS AND SERVICES</h3>
                        <p>We are not a lender and is not responsible for any lending product advertised or offered to you, or for any credit decisions made about you. No specific loan products are offered to you on this Site. Specific loan products are
                            offered to you directly by the lender.</p>
                        <h3>ESIGN CONSENT</h3>
                        <p>You agree that clicking “Get Started” (or other such button you use to submit your loan request) acts as your electronic signature. You further consent that we and any lender we share your request with can communicate with you
                            electronically and that any required disclosures may be provided to you electronically, including without limitation any notices of adverse action that a lender is required send to you. You also confirm that you have the ability
                            to access documents electronically, including the ability to view and save PDF files.</p>
                        <h3>LOAN INQUIRY POLICY</h3>
                        <p>We reserve the right to reject your inquiry at any time for any reason not prohibited by law. We may require additional information or verification before your loan request is accepted. When you submit your information through
                            a form on our Site, you will be connected with a lender for further consideration based on the lender's policies and procedures. This does not mean your loan has been approved. Loan approval is solely the lender's decision.
                            We are not responsible for taking, approving or denying your loan request. By submitting your information, you agree that if we cannot find a lender that can offer you the type of loan you initially requested, we will search
                            our network of lenders to see if we can find other lenders with different loan products to help you.</p>
                        <h3>CREDIT REFERENCES</h3>
                        <p>Participating lenders may verify your social security number, driver's license number or other federal or state identification, as well as review your credit worthiness through national databases that may include Equifax, Transunion,
                            Experian and other credit bureaus. By submitting your information to us, you agree that lenders may obtain such credit reports and verify your information.</p>
                        <h3>RESTRICTIONS</h3>

                            (but are not obligated to) conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of the suspected violation and the appropriate enforcement action to be taken. During such investigation, we may suspend services to any

                            Participating lenders may verify your social security number, driver's license number or other federal or state identification, as well as review your credit worthiness through national databases that may include Equifax, Transunion, Experian and other
                            credit bureaus. By submitting your information to us, you agree that lenders may obtain such credit reports and verify your information.

                            Not all lenders can provide you with a loan. If you are approved, you will receive funds according to the lender's funding practices which vary from lender to lender. Repayment terms also vary from lender to lender and may be affected by state law. If
                            you have questions about the loan terms offered to you, or about a loan that has funded, please contact the lender directly. We are not a lender and cannot give you loan-specific information.

                            You will not be charged a fee for using our service. Loan-related fees are controlled by the lender and will be disclosed to you before you accept the loan. If you do not want to incur loan-related fees or you are unable to repay your loan, do not accept
                            the loan.
