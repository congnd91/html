We are able to provide detailed schedules, budgets, alternative design studies, product selection and LEED integration, risk and procurement management.

<p><strong>Bid Build</strong><br />
As the most traditional method of construction, we provide a fix cost to complete the work as designed by the client's consultants. Through the Bid-Build process we review all associated documents, provide feedback, then determine a single cost to complete your project to your as established by the contract documents. We analyze the drawings and associated documents, identify all critical path items and execute to exceed the clients expectations. Ensuring the project surpasses all standards of quality, within the deliverable time line, becomes our ultimate goal.</p><br /><br />
