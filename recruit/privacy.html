          <h3>Privacy policy</h3>
          <p>
            <strong> Recruit.net Privacy Commitment</strong><br/> Recruit.net is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We respect your personal information and comply with all relevant legislation and requirements for governing the collection and use of data protection and privacy.</p>
          <p>

            In doing so, will ensure compliance by our officers and staff to the strictest standards of security and confidentiality in respect of all personal information and data submitted by users via <a href="#" title="">https://www.recruit.net</a> and its sub-domains (collectively, "Website")</p>
          <p>

            Recruit.net will not, subject to the terms herein, release such personal information to anyone without the prior consent of the relevant users of the Website</p>
          <p>

            Recruit.net pledges to meet fully with the requirements of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Chapter 486 of the Laws of Hong Kong. In doing so Recruit.net will ensure compliance by its officers and staff to the strictest standards of security and confidentiality in respect of all personal information and data submitted by users</p>
          <p>

            Furthermore Recruit.net undertakes to process your data as provided by applicable personal data protection regulations. In particular, Recruit.net will comply with the provisions of REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46EC (hereinafter, the <strong>“General Data Protection Regulation” or “GDPR“)</strong> and any other related regulations which may be in force from time to time.</p>
          <p>

            This document (last updated on May 30, 2018) sets out the privacy policy of Recruit.net Limited of Unit 2307, 23/F., Enterprise Square Three, 39 Wang Chiu Road, Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong.</p>
          <p>

            <strong>Information Collection and Use</strong><br/> When you register on the website and when you make use of our services, you will be asked to provide us with certain personal information. We collect personal information such as name and email during registration. Additionally, we collect demographic information that you supply when you upload your resume and insert details, such as your address, work experience, location, salary details and education background.</p>
          <p>

            We do not disclose to any third party information about your individual visits to the website or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, email address, etc. unless we have your permission or we believe the law permits or requires it.</p>
          <p>

            We may use your personally identifiable information to process your registration, provide personal career management tools (such as job search agents / alerts, resume databases,) identify personal preferences and match your needs with relevant products and services.</p>
          <p>

            Where you have indicated at registration (and at any time thereafter) that you are happy to receive employer highlights, job alerts, and other promotions from selected companies, you consent to us sending you such offers. You may opt out of receiving such offers or change your preferences from receiving promotional communications from us and other companies at any time by logging into your "My Recruit.net" account and changing your preferences, or by emailing: <a href="#" title="">dataprotection@recruit.net</a></p>
          <p>

            You acknowledge that when submitting your resume for storage in our resume database, your resume is automatically searchable by employers, recruiters, hiring managers and human resource professionals (the "Employers") who pay for access to our resume database. Recruit.net is not responsible for the use made of resumes by Employers who accessed your resume whilst it resides in our database. Recruit.net will attempt to limit access to our resume database to the Employers, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. Recruit.net has implemented and follows industry standard measures to protect against unauthorized access to and unlawful interception or processing of Personal Information. However, no internet website can fully eliminate security risks.</p>
          <p>

            We do our best to ensure that the ability to contact individuals in the resume database is restricted to bona-fide clients such as recruiters, hiring managers, consultants and HR professionals. However, we are not responsible if some other third party posing as a bona-fide recruiter becomes a client, gains access to the resume database and subsequently contacts you. You may remove your resume(s) from our database at any time. However you should note that current or former clients of Recruit.net may have retained a copy of your anonymous resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of this resume in these circumstances.</p>
          <p>

            Personal data collected via the Websites may be transferred, stored and processed in any country in which Recruit.net or its affiliates operate. By using the Website, Users are deemed to have agreed to, consented to and authorized Recruit.net to transfer their personal information and data outside of the Users' country.</p>
          <p>

            Personal data submitted by users will be used for the sole purpose of assisting the Job Seeker to find appropriate employment. Users can have their personal data removed from Recruit.net at any time by emailing <a href="#" title="">dataprotection@recruit.net</a></p>
          <p>

            <strong>Retention of personal information:</strong><br/> We will retain the personal information submitted by you after the deactivation of your service with Recruit.net unless we receive a written request from you to erase your personal information from our database. You can send a written request to <a href="#" title="">dataprotection@recruit.net</a></p>
          <p>

            <strong>Consent</strong><br/> By registering on the Website, you signify your consent to us collecting and using your personal information for the purposes described here. Should we elect to make a material change to our Privacy Policy, we will notify you of those changes both here in our Privacy Policy, and by email or by notice on our home page if identifiable personal data is involved so that you may make an informed decision and keep your preferences up to date</p>
          <p>

            Recruit.net offers any user the choice to utilize the Recruit.net website. If you create a resume on, upload your resume to or apply to a job through or otherwise use the Recruit.net website, you are specifically consenting to the use of any personal information you have provided to Recruit.net as set forth herein and in the Terms of Service.</p>
          <p>

            <strong>Contact and Resume Information</strong><br/> When you give Recruit.net contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information, you agree that Recruit.net may utilize this information as set forth herein. You agree that Recruit.net may, as part of its services to you, communicate with you, or initiate communication with you on behalf of a 3rd party, through your Recruit.net account or through other means made available through your contact information such as email, phone, or postal mail. If and to the extent permitted by applicable law, Recruit.net, or its designated third party partners, may also use your contact information to (i) send you job alerts; (ii) create an account; (iii) send you information about Recruit.net. Recruit.net may use demographic and/or profile data to tailor your experience on Recruit.net to , show you content that Recruit.net thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. Your personal information gets placed on the Recruit.net Website when you upload or edit a resume. To the extent you upload a resume or edit it, and subject to your Privacy Settings, you are making the resume, your name and other personal information that you place on your resume available to third parties who may be interested in you as an employee, search engines, or to the general public by posting your personal information on the internet. This may be crawled by, and displayed through, search engines when someone searches for your name. This means that third parties can view the personal information contained in your resume and you may receive unsolicited contact from parties unaffiliated with Recruit.net and for whom Recruit.net has no responsibility. If you do not want your personal information posted on the Website, you should not upload it. You may opt-out of this feature by editing your Privacy Settings; however, Recruit.net does not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their caches, which may contain old public resume information. Recruit.net reserves the right to charge third parties a fee for accessing your information as part of Recruit.net’s services. At your direction, Recruit.net may also send your resume to third parties if you choose to apply for a job listing.</p>
          <p>

            <strong>Business transfer</strong><br/> We may transfer, sell or assign any of the information described in this policy to third parties as a result of a sale, merger, consolidation, change of control, transfer of assets or reorganization of Recruit.net Ltd. In the event Recruit.net goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via Website email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>
          <p>

            <strong>Cookies</strong><br/> We may use small text files called cookies to improve overall Website experience.
