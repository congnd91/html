                <div class="content">
                    <div class="w840">
                        <p>Glucomannan and cellulose are an ideal way to fight cravings for the following reasons:</p>
                        <p>Unlike other macronutrients such as fats, proteinds, or carbohydrates - which the body breaks down and absorbs - fiber isn’t digested by our body, because fiber has no macronutrients.</p>
                        <p>1. Instead, it passe relatively intact through the stomach, small intestine, and colon.</p>
                        <p>2. While in our digestive tract, the soluble fiber in glucomannan absorbs water. The fiber expands to many times its original size.</p>
                        <p>3 Then our gut microbes egin playing a major role. When an individual takes glucomannan, the healthy bacteria feeds on the soluble fiber. As a by-product of eating fiber, the bacteria release a short-chain fatty acide caled acetate.</p>
                        <p>4. Acetate then enters the bloodstream and travels to the brain. The portion of our brain responsible for the metabolic processes, the hypothalamus, reacts to this chemical, signaling us to stop eating. In other words, it stops the desire to eat.</p>
